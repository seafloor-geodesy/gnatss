# Welcome to GNATSS!

GNATSS is an open-source software for processing Global Navigation Satellite Systems - Acoustic (GNSS-A) data for seafloor horizontal positioning.
The software is a redevelopment of existing FORTRAN codes and shell scripts developed by C. David Chadwell for processing data including measurements made with Wave Gliders.
Existing code, which includes proprietary routines, is developed and maintained by John DeSanto.

## Project overview

Near-Trench Community Geodetic Experiment is a five-year NSF-funded project that will establish open and accessible seafloor deformation data offshore Alaska and Cascadia,
in regions responsible for some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis ever recorded.

Check out the [Seafloor Geodesy](https://www.seafloorgeodesy.org/) website for more information about the community project.
